            <h1>Privacy Policy - Oshyn, Inc.</h1>
            We Value Your Privacy
            <br />
            We fervently believe in the privacy of individuals - integrity and simplicity are two values we hold most dear as an organization, so here you go.
            Oshyn, Inc., Inc. respects your right to privacy, and we believe any information you provide to us should be protected from disclosure to others. We have prepared this Statement of Privacy to inform you as to how we gather information on our web site, how we manage and safeguard your information, to whom we distribute this information, and under what circumstances the information is distributed.
            <h2>Collection of Personal Information</h2>
            In general, you can visit Oshyn, Inc.'s web site without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. However, certain pages on our web site request personal information from you, such as if you register for our newsletter, register for a class, register for a seminar, or request information about our products. The requested information typically includes contact information such as name, address, telephone number and email address. Revealing personal information is completely voluntary and the user therefore has the choice whether or not to disclose this information.
            <h2>Use of Personal Information</h2>
            The personal information that you reveal will be used to fulfill your request. In addition, Oshyn, Inc. may use this information to send you the Oshyn, Inc. newsletter or information on Oshyn, Inc.'s products and services. Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option to not receive these types of communications. Please see the Opt-out section. Oshyn, Inc. occasionally hires other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, such as mailing our newsletter. We will only provide those companies the information they need to deliver the service, and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose. We may at times also share your information with third parties who have products or services which we believe may be of use to you.Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our web site. In addition, Oshyn, Inc. may disclose personal information if it believes in good faith that such action is necessary to protect the personal safety of users of Oshyn, Inc., its web sites, or the public.
            <h2>Cookies</h2>
            Oshyn, Inc. uses cookies. A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user.

            <h2>Log Files</h2>
            Like most standard web site servers we use log files. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information. We use a tracking utility called Google analytics that uses log files to analyze user movement.
